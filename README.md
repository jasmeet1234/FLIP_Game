## Introduction

Flip is an engaging memory matching game designed to test and improve your memory skills. It features an intuitive user interface and addictive gameplay. The game aims to challenge players to quickly identify and match pairs of cards in the least amount of time.

## Game Modes

### 1. Casual Mode

Casual mode is suitable for beginners and those who want a more relaxed gaming experience. The number of cards in this mode is limited, making it easier to remember the positions and match them.

### 2. Hard Mode

Hard mode is for the real memory masters! It presents a higher difficulty level by increasing the number of cards on the board. Only the most skilled players can conquer this mode.

1. Choose your preferred game mode - Casual or Hard.
2. Once the game starts, you will see a grid of facedown cards.
3. Click on any two facedown cards to flip them face up.
